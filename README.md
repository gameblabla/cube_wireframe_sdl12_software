 Example of a rotating cube implemented using only wireframe graphics and integer math.
 I was looking for a simple example of a rotating cube that could be implemented easily on low end hardware so hopefully this helps.
 
 This was implemented with SDL 1.2 and RGB565 mode but it can be done for 8bpp or even 2bpp. (and other exotic platforms)
